.py - Regular scripts
.py3 - (rarely used) Python3 script. Python3 scripts usually end with ".py" not ".py3", but I have seen that a few times
.pyc - compiled script (Bytecode)
.pyo - optimized pyc file (As of Python3.5, Python will only use pyc rather than pyo and pyc)
.pyw - Python script for Windows. It is executed with pythonw.exe
.pyx - Cython src to be converted to C/C++
.pyd - Python script made as a Windows DLL
.pxd - Cython script which is equivalent to a C/C++ header
.pxi - MyPy stub
.pyi - Stub file (PEP 484)
.pyz - Python script archive (PEP 441); this is a script containing compressed Python scripts (ZIP) in binary form after the standard Python script header
.pywz - Python script archive for MS-Windows (PEP 441); this is a script containing compressed Python scripts (ZIP) in binary form after the standard Python script header
.py[cod] - wildcard notation in ".gitignore" that means the file may be ".pyc", ".pyo", or ".pyd".
