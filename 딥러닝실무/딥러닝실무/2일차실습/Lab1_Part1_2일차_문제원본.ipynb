    "TensorFlow is called TensorFlow because it handles the flow (node/mathematical operation) of Tensors (data). You can think of a Tensor as a multidimensional array. In TensorFlow, computations are represented as graphs. TensorFlow programs are usually structured into a phase that assembles a graph, and a phase that uses a session to execute operations in the graph. In TensorFlow we define the computational graph with Tensors and mathematical operations to create a system for machine learning and deep learning.\n",
